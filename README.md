## How Minimax Works

The Minimax Algorithm is a recursive strategy used in decision-making and game-playing. It evaluates possible moves and chooses the optimal path to maximize AI's chance of winning while minimizing the opponent's.

**Steps:**

1. AI checks all possible moves.

2. Assigns scores to board states (+10 for win, -10 for loss, 0 for draw).

3. Selects the move with the highest minimax score.
